# REST API REPL Client

## Description
REST API REPL Client is a developer tool designed for Android devices meant to provide functionality similar to web and desktop-based HTTP clients such as Postman, Paw, hurl.it, Fiddler, and ApiKitchen.
<br/><br/><b>Features:</b>
<br/>&#8226;&#8195;Test and debug RESTful web services, APIs, and HTTP requests with this developer tool for Android clients.
<br/>&#8226;&#8195;Easily construct requests against any URL using the common HTTP methods.
<br/>&#8226;&#8195;Supply custom headers, query params, and body content including multipart or url-encoded form data, files, JSON, XML, or other raw types.
<br/>&#8226;&#8195;Inspect response bodies and headers then copy any of the returned data to use in your subsequent requests.
<br/>&#8226;&#8195;Responses are displayed with indentation and proper formatting for JSON, XML, and HTML, or in raw form if they do not match any of those formats.
<br/>&#8226;&#8195;A complete history of your requests is retained and accessible for reloading into the form allowing you to view, copy, modify, and re-send requests using  any or all of the previous data.
